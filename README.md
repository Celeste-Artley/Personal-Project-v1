# My first project Movie Organization Tool / Personal Website
## created using a LAMP stack
This is my first attempt web design, I did this in my spare time during my first semester of community college. 
The goal of this site was to create a portfolio that I could show to potential employers to demonstrate my passion for development and overcoming challenges.
I picked the lamp stack because it was the only thing I was aware of at the time, and it seemed cool to have everything hosted on a linux box like a 1337 hacker :)
Please enjoy my permanent record of where I started, and the thing that defines how far I have come.
